Summary of the lecture on May 13:
Markdown is a lightweight markup language. It can be used to create web pages.
We will code with Markdown using an extension 'Markdown All in One' in VS Code.
This extension lets us preview the changes made.

# : is used to create a title
## : is used to create a subsection
For example,
# CS102 : creates a title 'CS102'
## Section 1 : creates a subsection 'Section 1'
Using more number of hashes, we can reduce the level of the section.
To add text in the sections, we simply need to type it below the section heading.
